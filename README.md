# Serratus

Serratus is a collaborative Open Science project for ultra-rapid discovery of all viruses.

### Background

_Forewarned is Forearmed._

Our primary goal is to generate the viral data to accelerate the global research efforts in fighting emerging pathogens. We are re-analyzing all RNA-seq, meta-genomics, meta-transcriptomics and environmental sequencing data in the NCBI Short Read Archive to discover new viruses. That is **>6 million biological samples** or >10 petabases of sequencing data.

### Contribute to Serratus
