# Serratus

Serratus is a collaborative Open Science project for ultra-rapid discovery of known and unknown coronaviruses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Background
While there is an intense research effort to sequence and analyze SARS-CoV-2 isolates for tracking real-time virus evolution, our understanding of the virus's evolutionary origins is limited by incomplete genomic characterization of other members of the Coronaviridae (CoV) and related families.

We are re-analyzing all RNA-seq, meta-genomics, meta-transcriptomics and environmental sequencing data in the NCBI Short Read Archive to discover new sequence biodiversity of coronaviruses. That is **>3.4 million biological samples** or >5 petabases of sequencing data.

### Contribute to Serratus
The `Serratus` team is actively looking to collaborate with all scientists and developers.

# Data Release Policy
Our primary goal is to generate the coronavirus data to accelerate the global research efforts in fighting SARS-CoV-2. To achieve this:
- All software development is open-source and freely available (GPLv3)
- All sequencing data generated, raw and processed, will be freely and immediatly available in the public domain in accordance with the [Bermuda Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Principles) set out by the Human Genome Project.
